# 🎬 Video Processing Script - Complete Setup

## ✅ What's Been Created

Your Node.js video processing script is ready! Here's what I've set up for you:

### 📁 New Files Created:
- `src/make-video.js` - Main CLI script
- `src/portable-video-processor.js` - Core video processing logic with FFmpeg auto-detection
- `src/video-processor.js` - Simple video processor (backup)
- `VIDEO_PROCESSING.md` - Detailed feature documentation
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions

### 📦 Dependencies Added:
- `fluent-ffmpeg` - Node.js FFmpeg wrapper (already installed)

### 🚀 NPM Script Added:
- `npm run make_video {n}` - Process video with index n (1-5)

## 🎯 Usage (After FFmpeg Installation)

```bash
# Process video 1 with random audio start
npm run make_video 1

# Process video 3 with random audio start
npm run make_video 3

# Process video 5 with random audio start
npm run make_video 5
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Install FFmpeg (Required)

**Quick Install via Chocolatey:**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
choco install ffmpeg
```

**Or download manually:**
- Download from: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- Extract to `C:\ffmpeg`
- Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to PATH

### 2. Test the Script
```bash
npm run make_video 1
```

## 🎉 What It Does

1. **Takes your video** (e.g., `videos/1.mp4`)
2. **Takes your audio** (`sound/videoplayback.m4a`)
3. **Starts audio from random position** each time you run it
4. **Merges them perfectly** - audio duration matches video duration
5. **Saves result** in `processed_videos/` folder

## 📊 Example Output

```
🚀 Starting video processing...

## 🛠️ Smart Features

- ✅ **Auto-detects FFmpeg** (system or portable)
- ✅ **Clear error messages** with installation help
- ✅ **Progress tracking** during processing
- ✅ **File validation** before processing
- ✅ **Unique output names** (no overwrites)
- ✅ **Preserves video quality** (copies video stream)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Script shows FFmpeg not found?
1. Install FFmpeg using the instructions above
2. Restart your terminal
3. Try again

### "Video file not found" error?
- Make sure you have `1.mp4`, `2.mp4`, etc. in the `videos/` folder
- Use index 1-5 only

### "Audio file not found" error?
- Make sure `videoplayback.m4a` exists in the `sound/` folder

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Once FFmpeg is installed, you can run:
```bash
npm run make_video 1
```

Each run will create a unique video with audio starting from a different random position! Perfect for creating variations of your content.
